## Data retrieval 
The dataset is available in the following link: https://www.exploredata.net/Downloads/Microbiome-Data-Set. In particular, we work with the files MicrobiomeWithMetadata.csv as well as the glossary and the dictionary. 

The data can be retrieved programatically when executing the code, from a file ID on Google Drive. The user needs to login to Google Drive with a valid account to able to download the data. Once logged in a compressed zip folder will start downloading and it will be directed to the _raw/ folder, which is ignored by git to avoid having data on it.  

## Navigation through this directory 
* [R](https://github.com/rforbiodatascience24/group_16_project/tree/main/R): this folder contains the scripts for data loading, cleanig, augmentation, description and analysis.
