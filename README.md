## Data retrieval 
The dataset is available in the following link: https://www.exploredata.net/Downloads/Microbiome-Data-Set. In particular, we work with the files MicrobiomeWithMetadata.csv as well as the glossary and the dictionary. 

The data can be retrieved programatically when executing the code, from a file ID on Google Drive. The user needs to register to Google Drive with a valid account.
